# IRR Calculator

## Description
This Java program implements an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculator. IRR is a financial metric used to estimate the profitability of an investment. It represents the rate at which the net present value of cash flows from an investment becomes zero. A higher IRR typically signifies a more profitable investment compared to the company's cost of capital.

## How to Use
1. Run the Java application.
2. The GUI interface will prompt you to enter the initial cost and the number of cash flows.
3. Upon entering the necessary information, click the "Calculate IRR" button.
4. Subsequently, a series of dialogs will request the user to input cash flow values for each period.
5. After inputting the cash flows, the program will compute the IRR.
6. The IRR result will be displayed in a dialog box.
7. Finally, a "Thank you" message will be displayed, and the program will exit.

## Instructions
- The application uses Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and accepts user input through dialog boxes.
- Ensure to enter numerical values when prompted.
- The IRR calculation is performed based on the cash flow values provided by the user and the initial cost.
